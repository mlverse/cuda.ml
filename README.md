`cuml4r` provides a simple and intuitive R interface for
[cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml), a suite of GPU-accelerated machine
learning libraries powered by [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

`cuml4r` is under active development, and currently supports ML algorithms such
as kmeans, dbscan, and random forest classifier / regressor.
